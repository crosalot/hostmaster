6.x-1.6
=======

Features:
- Transform function triggerParentEvent() into a method of the modalFrameChild object, so it can be easily reused.
- Added onLoad option to client-side modal frame (callback to invoke when the child document in the modal frame is fully loaded).
- Package name replaced from "User interface" to "Modal frame", because we now have the modalframe_contrib package that provides a few modules that implement Modal Frame API for common day to day tasks.
- Added onLoad event handler for the iframe element to catch up bugs in server-side of child processing when modalframe_child_js() is not invoked.
- Added Drupal.theme('modalFrameThrobber') as a helper theme function that can be reused elsewhere.
- Performance enhancement: prevent template_preprocess_page() from generating sidebar blocks when a modal frame has been requested.
